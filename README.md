# PTT Kargo API Integration

This application allows you to create, cancel, and track shipments for **PTT Kargo**.

---

## Requirements

- **Static IP Address:** It is recommended to register your server's **static IP address** with PTT Kargo for a more reliable connection when making API calls.
- **API Credentials:** Add the credentials (customer number and password) provided by PTT Kargo to the `soapController` file.

---

## API Configuration

You need to add the API credentials provided by PTT Kargo to the `soapController` file.

Below is a sample configuration:

```javascript
const config = {
    musterNo: 'your_musterino', // Customer number provided by PTT Kargo
    sifre: 'your_password' // Password provided by PTT Kargo
}
```

---

## Features

- **Shipment Creation:** You can create new shipments.
- **Shipment Cancellation:** Cancel existing shipments.
- **Shipment Tracking:** Track your shipments.

---

## ZPL Barcode Label Generation

The application uses the `cargo kabulEkle` function to generate ZPL codes after creating a new barcode. These ZPL codes are designed to print **10x15-sized labels** on Zebra printers.

- You can preview the generated barcode label by pasting the ZPL code into [Labelary](https://labelary.com/viewer.html).
- If you need to print the label with a different device, you must create a custom label compatible with that device.
- The barcode labels generated by this application are fully compatible with **all Zebra printer models**.

---

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies in the project directory:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Update the API credentials in the `soapController` file:
   - `musterNo` (Customer Number)
   - `sifre` (Password)

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Verify the functionality by testing API calls and previewing ZPL barcode labels as needed.

---

## Notes

- If your static IP address is not registered, you may encounter API access issues.
- Ensure your API keys and passwords are stored securely.
